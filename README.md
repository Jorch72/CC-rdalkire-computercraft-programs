computercraft-programs
======================

Lua scripts for [computercraft](http://www.computercraft.info/), dan200's minecraft mod. 

## The Turtle Apps
So far, all the focus of this work has been for the robot; you can find the programs and other files under the turtleApps/src directory, for food-farming, block-making
and obby-making.


## The Operation Manuals, Launchers, Test Stubs and Harnesses

Each of the completed programs has its own help document in markdown format: farmHowTo.md, obbyMinerHowTo.md <TODO> and sortAndBlockHowTo.md

TODO: Fill in wiki pages with links to the how-to markdown files.

There's a launcher called startup.lua, so that a player might launch a turtle program with a button-click or by opening a trapped chest.

Test harnesses include testFarm.lua and testMockTurtle, so you can unit test and debug before migrating code to your Minecraft client.

mockTurtle.lua is a "stub" for the test harnesses.
